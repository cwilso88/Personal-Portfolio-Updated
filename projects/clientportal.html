    <P>
        The client portal application was created with React JS, Redux, Bootstrap for styling, and firebase for authentication. The fully Create Read Update and Delete (CRUD) application allows for the user to register with a current email address to create an account and work with the information of the client and keep track of each client's balance. 
    </P>
